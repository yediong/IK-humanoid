## 1. Creating a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to run training or deployment programs in a virtual environment. Conda is recommended for creating virtual environments. If Conda is already installed on your system, you can skip step 1.1.

### 1.1 Download and Install MiniConda

MiniConda is a lightweight distribution of Conda, suitable for creating and managing virtual environments. Use the following commands to download and install:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
```

After installation, initialize Conda:

```bash
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init --all
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 1.2 Create a New Environment

Use the following command to create a virtual environment:

```bash
conda create -n unitree-rl python=3.8
```

### 1.3 Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
conda activate unitree-rl
```

#### 2.2.2 Install

After extracting the package, navigate to the `isaacgym/python` folder and install it using the following commands:

```bash
cd isaacgym/python
pip install -e .
```

#### 2.2.3 Verify Installation

Run the following command. If a window opens displaying 1080 balls falling, the installation was successful:

```bash
cd examples
python 1080_balls_of_solitude.py
```

If you encounter any issues, refer to the official documentation at `isaacgym/docs/index.html`.
